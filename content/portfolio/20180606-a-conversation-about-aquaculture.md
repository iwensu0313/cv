EVENT OVERVIEW

_Aquaculture is a fascinating industry that intersects with many different fields that we study here at Bren. We want to hold a ‘Night of Aquaculture’ to allow participants to explore a range of topics, discuss current industry direction and development, and to have the opportunity to connect with people based in California doing important work in the aquaculture space._

_By touching on aspects of aquaculture such as sustainable environmental practices, feed formulations, genetics, creative permitting solutions, and international aquaculture development, we hope to give students at Bren, UCSB, and interested members of the public a broad understanding of where aquaculture is, where it’s going, and how they can contribute to and learn more about the field._

_Guest speakers will give short 5-8 minute talks on topics ranging from alternative feed to the permitting process in California. This will be followed by a Q&A session and an opportunity to eat, drink, mingle and check out the sunset from the Bren balcony._
