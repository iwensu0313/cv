[Rladies](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu). [Bren](http://bren.ucsb.edu). These are communities that helped me develop rigorous standards and unmatched skills in science computing through immersion in the R world. My underlying passion is in ocean science and conservation. R became my vessel for doing science more efficiently and creating new insights from exisiting stores and stores of scientific data that have been feverishly collected by any means that we can. I spent two years engaging, learning, troubleshooting through `ggplot`, `shiny`, `stringr`, `datetimes`, the list goes on.

Then, I had to pivot. I got a new work computer. I had to re-install all my favorite R packages. Worst of all, I had to learn python.

Just kidding. I was actually quite eager to learn. And here was my opportunity to fully dive into in a world that I knew nothing about. Not yet.
